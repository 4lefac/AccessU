#### STEP 1

Install Xcode

You will need a developer account and it should be free so do not pay for one!

#### STEP 2

Now you can actually run from the command line if you would like. CD into the AccessU directory in the terminal. Then run:

    react-native run-ios

Run the command to install and run the app on a connected device:

    react-native run-android
